# .me Suite - Your AI Playground
For every recursive action, there's a repercussion.

```
npm install this.me
```

**Docs:** [this.me](https://www.neurons.me/this-me)

### Conceptual Flow:

- [ ] Set up your context with [this.me.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/this.me)

- [ ] Create a neural network using [neurons.me](https://www.neurons.me).

- [ ] Define the data you'd like your neural network to recognize or process with [this.](https://www.neurons.me/this) modules.

- [ ] Use [this.be](https://www.npmjs.com/package/this.be) to maintain a state or context, - watching over  [This](https://www.neurons.me/this) and any other states you define for example.

- [ ] Define desired status and handlers, [be.this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/be.this).

- [ ] Keep [i.mlearning](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i.mlearning).

  

## Setting up your Context. 	👋🏻👋🏼👋🏽👋🏾👋🏿
Defining the environment and context in which your code runs, especially when you're interacting with intelligent agents or services like me.
Having a clear declaration of the environment and the context can have a series of implications for security, interoperability, and clarity. Let's delve into the importance of such declarations:

### Security Context:
Defining the environment ensures that both the user and the IA have a clear understanding of the boundary within which interactions take place.
Explicitly stating the environment can prevent unintended cross-boundary actions. For instance, without a clear declaration, an IA might access files or services that are beyond its permitted scope, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.
A well-defined environment acts as a sandbox that can restrict unauthorized or unintended activities. For instance, browsers use a similar principle to run JavaScript in a sandboxed environment for security reasons.

**Interoperability:**
As the ecosystem of software and services becomes increasingly diverse, ensuring your code can interact smoothly with other systems becomes crucial.
Declaring the environment or context helps ensure that all systems are on the "same page". For example, if an IA knows it's operating within the ".me" context, it can adjust its behavior, assumptions, and dependencies accordingly.

**Auditability and Compliance:**
For industries or applications where audit trails and compliance are important, having a clear declaration of the environment ensures that every interaction and operation can be traced back to a defined context.
Such clear demarcations can aid in forensic analysis if something goes wrong or if there's a need to understand the context of an interaction.

# Context of Abstraction for Machine Learning Standardization

Traditional web development elements, from images to audio, are designed mainly for display and interaction. But what if they could be seamlessly converted into standardized formats primed for machine learning? That's the vision behind the **this.** modules.

An Introduction to the this. JavaScript Library: Standardizing Web Development Elements for Machine Learning.

## Principles Behind the this. Library:

- ### **Abstraction for ML:**

 The library's core principle is to abstract traditional web elements so that they're immediately primed for machine learning. It's about viewing web content not just as data but as structured, consistent, and standardized data.

- ### **Built on Web Standards:** 

Rooted in JavaScript, the this. library builds upon public web development standards. The aim is to ensure that developers remain within familiar territories, even as they venture into the world of machine learning.

- ### **Open and Collaborative:** 

The this. library champions open standards. By leveraging public web standards, it invites collaboration, hoping to create a community that continually refines and enhances the bridge between web development and machine learning.
