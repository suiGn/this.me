# THIS.ME  

**This.Me** is a data-structured identity.

1. **Install `this.me`:**
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install the `this.me` package:

   ```js
   npm install this.me
   ```

2. **Import `Me` in Your Project:**
   In the JavaScript file where you want to use `this.me`, import the `Me` class.

   ```js
   import Me from 'this.me';
   ```

   **Explanation**

   ​	1.	**Dynamic Identity Addition**:

   ​	•	The **be** method in the **Me** class accepts an object of **key-value pairs** and **adds these to the identity object**.

   ​	2.	**Flexible Attribute Addition**:

   ​	•	You can call **me.be()** multiple times with different attributes to dynamically update the identity object.

   ```javascript
   // Create a new Me instance
   let me = new Me("xyxyxy");
   
   // Add attributes to the identity
   me.be({ a: "XXX", b: "YYY" });
   me.be({ c: "z" });
   ```

**A less abstract example:**

```js
// Add attributes to the identity
me.be({ name: "XXXY WWC", phone: "33550000" });
```

​		**Dynamic Property Assignment**:

​	•	We use an object users to store Me instances, with each key being the username.

​	•	`users[username] = new Me(username)` dynamically assigns the Me instance to a key that matches the username.

​		**Accessing Instances**:

​	•	You can access the Me instance using the username as the key: `users['suign']`.

​		**Adding Attributes**:

​	•	The **be()** method is used to add attributes to the identity object.

.	**Example Usage**:

​	•	Two users, user1 and user2, are created and their identities are dynamically managed within the **users** object.

### Neural Networks - **One-Hot Encoding**

------

To represent the combinations of **“me, you, him, her, it, us, them”** in a neural network, we need to convert the elements into a suitable format for neural network processing, such as one-hot encoding, and design a neural network architecture that can process these inputs.

Here’s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1.	**One-Hot Encoding:** Convert each element (“me”, “you”, “him”, “her”, “it”, “us”, “them”) into a one-hot encoded vector.
2.	**Combination Representation:** Create input vectors for each combination by combining the one-hot encoded vectors.
3.	**Neural Network Design:** Design a simple neural network to process these input vectors.

#### Step 1: One-Hot Encoding

One-hot encoding represents each element as a binary vector with a single high (1) value and the rest low (0). For the elements “me”, “you”, “him”, “her”, “it”, “us”, “them”, we can assign the following one-hot encoded vectors:

```js
// Create Me instances
const meInstance = new Me('me');
const youInstance = new Me('you');
const himInstance = new Me('him');
const herInstance = new Me('her');
const itInstance = new Me('it');
const usInstance = new Me('us');
const themInstance = new Me('them');

// One-hot encoding representation
const subjects = {
  'me': [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  'you': [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  'him': [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  'her': [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
  'it': [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  'us': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  'them': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
};
```

#### Step 2: Combination Representation

For each combination, we can create an input vector by combining the one-hot encoded vectors of its elements. For example:

Combination “me, you” would be represented as the sum of the one-hot vectors for “me” and “you”:

```
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] + [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

Hello, I am .me
? Who are you? (Use arrow keys)
❯ add.me 
---

1. **Install `this.me`:**
   Open your terminal and run the following command to install the `this.me` package:
   
   ```js
   npm install this.me
   ```
   
2. **Import `Me` in Your Project:**
   In the JavaScript file where you want to use `this.me`, import the `Me` class.
   
   ```js
   import Me from 'this.me';
   ```
   
3. **Create an Instance of `Me`:**
   Instantiate the `Me` class with the required user details.
   
   ```js
   const user = new Me('John', 'Doe', '1990-01-01', 'password123', '1234');
   ```
   
4. **Validate and Use the Instance:**
   Utilize the instance for user data validation and preparation for cryptographic actions.
   In other words. Log In.
   ```js
   try {
       const identity = user.getMe();
       // Ready for hashing and cryptographic signatures
   } catch (error) {
       console.error(error.message);
       // Error handling for missing fields
   }
   ```

This quick start guide provides a straightforward path to incorporating `this.me` into your project, enabling you to manage user identities and prepare them for secure cryptographic processes efficiently.
